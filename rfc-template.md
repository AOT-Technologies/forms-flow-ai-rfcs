## Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and
non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

## Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?


## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure you’ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process, not an API.


### Alternatives Considered
* Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Performance Implications
List any performance implications you foresee if RFC is implemented.

### Dependencies
List any dependencies in implementing this RFC.


### Compatibility (Existing implementation Impact)
* Does the design conform to the backwards & forwards compatibility
* What are the migration approaches for a painless migration for existing application, customers.


## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if they’re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.
